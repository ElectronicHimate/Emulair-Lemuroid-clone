# Emulair - Lemuroid clone

This is a repository for the version of Emulair that is heavily based off of Lemuroid, so much so that it's basically a clone with barely any features added. I decided to archive this repo because I started rewriting Emulair from scratch (although I will still use some code from Lemuroid, shoutout Swordfish90 for his incredible work).

If you want to check out the progress on the development of the new Emulair-Android, follow this link: https://github.com/EmulairEmulator/Emulair-Android.

Of course, the rewritten Emulair will use the same GPL v3.0 license.
