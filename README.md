## Description
Emulair is an Android exclusive open-source front-end for Libretro cores, based on Lemuroid.

## Philosophy
The primary goal of Emulair is to combine the ease of use and simple but accessible interface of Lemuroid with Retroarch's extensive customisability and features.

## Origin
It originated from [Lemuroid](https://github.com/Swordfish90/Lemuroid), which, in turn, is a rib of [Retrograde](https://github.com/retrograde/retrograde-android). It also uses [LibretroDroid](https://github.com/Swordfish90/LibretroDroid) under the hood to run [Libretro](https://github.com/libretro) cores.

## Name Meaning
"Emulair" is a triple entendre and the name is inspired by the Lawnchair launcher (not associated with Emulair). Firstly, "Emulair" sounds similar to the word "Emulator" (if you try hard enough). Secondly, "Emulair" means "lair of the emu bird", an animal commonly associated with emulators, given their similar names. Lastly, "Emulair" also means "lair for all your emulators", which is similar to "Vimm's Lair", a place for preserving video games.
