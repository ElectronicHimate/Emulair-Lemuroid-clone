## Description
Emulair is an Android exclusive open-source front-end for Libretro cores, based on Lemuroid.

## Philosophy
The primary goal of Emulair is to combine the ease of use and simple but accessible interface of Lemuroid with Retroarch's extensive customisability and features.

## Origin
It originated from [Lemuroid](https://github.com/Swordfish90/Lemuroid), which, in turn, is a rib of [Retrograde](https://github.com/retrograde/retrograde-android). It also uses [LibretroDroid](https://github.com/Swordfish90/LibretroDroid) under the hood to run [Libretro](https://github.com/libretro) cores.
